Documentation helps onboarding, writing and using code.
Tests ensure code works as it did in the past.

## Classical styleguides
- Bootstrap, Foundation etc.
- Mainly documentation focussed
- Tend to be hard to maintain

Development in isolation

> By crafting your components and their API's in isolation, the quality and reuse potential of your UI investment is dramatically improved. You will be falling into the "pit of success" conforming to best-practices that also make your job faster and easier, and importantly - more fun.
