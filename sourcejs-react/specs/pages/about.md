#About pages

At the page stage, we break our chemistry analogy to get into language that makes more sense to our clients and our final output. Pages consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.

Pages are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms. Pages are also where clients start seeing the final design in place. In my experience working with this methodology, pages begin their life as HTML wireframes, but over time increase fidelity to ultimately become the final deliverable.
