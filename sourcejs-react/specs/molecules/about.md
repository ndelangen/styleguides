# About molecules

Things start getting more interesting and tangible when we start combining atoms together. Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. These molecules take on their own properties and serve as the backbone of our design systems.

For example, a form label, input or button arenâ€™t too useful by themselves, but combine them together as a form and now they can actually do something together.
